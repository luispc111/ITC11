### **How to contribute**

You can help the web page by making the JSON files of your study model. The format of the JSON files is:

```bash
[
    {
        "nombre": "subject name",
        "clave": "subject key",
        "semestre": 0,
        "requisitoAcreditado": ["subject key"],
        "requisitoCursado": ["subject key"]
    },
]
```

The list of "requisitoAcreditado" is a list of the classes you need to pass to be able to take the class and "requisitoCursado" is a list of classes you need to take.

We created a C++ program that reads a text file with the format shown below, based on how courses are presented SAMP from ITESM. 

```bash

Numero Semestre
Clave	        Nombre de la materia	CL	L	U	CA
ClaveEjemplo    Nombre ejemplo          1   1   1   1
1 1 1 1

```

### **Technical description**

HTML and CSS is used for the frontend. Some bootstrap elements are also included. 

Javascript is used for the modification of tables, changes in the progress bar, and creation of buttons to choose the study model.

JSON is used to have the information of the courses, as well as their semester and the requirements to register it. We use HTTP requests to access the JSON files, so to run locally the app you'll need to set up a server.

html2canvas library was used to generate the dowloadable png file of the modifications users create on their study plans.
